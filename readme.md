This is a port of [stream-pomodoro](https://github.com/tokisuno/stream-pomodoro) written in Go.

After hearing about the TypeScript interpreter being ported over to Go, it made me remember my time with go and how much I enjoyed making things in it. So I ported over some of what I had in C over to Go and I think this is what I want to continue using. Go is simple and efficient. I don't really care about memory management for the time being because most of what I do doesn't require it. C is still great though. It's just not what I need for the time being.
